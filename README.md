### Low Signal Disconnect (Lua)

This utility provides information on how many AP clients connected to the Wi-Fi device have a dBm signal above a settable threshold.
The information is updated periodically after a configurable interval.

Usage:
``` luajit lsd.lua <interface> <interval> <threshold> <loops>```
